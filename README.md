# Getting started

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

In the Project Navigator select your own project. Then select the project in the Project section and click on the
Package Dependencies tab. Click on the "+" button at the bottom. Paste the below url on the search bar on the top right.
Finaly click on "Add package" button.

```
 https://github.com/apivideo/api.video-swift-player
```

Or add this in your Package.swift

```
  dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apivideo/api.video-swift-player.git", from: "1.1.0"),
    ],
```

### Cocoapods

Add `pod 'ApiVideoPlayer', '1.1.0'` in your `Podfile`

Run `pod install`

## Retrieve your video Id

At this point, you must have uploaded a least one video to your account. If you haven't
see [how to upload a video](https://docs.api.video/docs/upload-a-video-regular-upload). You'll need
a video Id to use this component and play a video from api.video. To get yours, follow these steps:

1. [Log into your account](https://dashboard.api.video/login) or create
   one [here](https://dashboard.api.video/register).
2. Copy your API key (sandbox or production if you are subscribed to one of
   our [plan](https://api.video/pricing)).
3. Go to [the official api.video documentation](https://docs.api.video/docs).
4. Log into your account in the top right corner. If it's already done, be sure it's the account you
   want to use.
5. Go to API Reference -> Videos -> [List all videos](https://docs.api.video/reference/list-videos)
6. On the right, be sure the "Authentication" section contains the API key you want to use.
7. Generate your upload token by clicking the "Try It!" button in the right section
8. Copy the "videoId" value of one of elements of the response in the right section.

Alternatively, you can find your video Id in the video details of
your [dashboard](https://dashboard.api.video).

## Code sample

## Code sample

1. Imports the library

```
import ApiVideoPlayer
```

2. Instantiates the player view

```swift
let playerView: ApiVideoPlayerView = ApiVideoPlayerView(frame: .zero, videoOptions: VideoOptions(videoId: "YOUR_VIDEO_ID", videoType: .vod)) // for private video VideoOptions(videoId: "YOUR_VIDEO_ID", videoType: .vod, token: "YOUR_PRIVATE_VIDEO_TOKEN")
```

3. Adds the player view as a subview of your view controller

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    ...
    self.addSubview(playerView)
}
```

4. Delegates the player events

To be able to use the player delegate, you must implement the PlayerDelegate protocol.

```swift
extension YourViewController: PlayerDelegate {
    public func didPrepare() {
        // Do what you want when didPrepare is called
    }

    public func didReady() {
        // Do what you want when didReady is called
    }

    public func didPause() {
        // Do what you want when didPause is called
    }

    public func didPlay() {
        // Do what you want when didPlay is called
    }

    public func didReplay() {
        // Do what you want when didReplay is called
    }

    public func didMute() {
        // Do what you want when didMute is called
    }

    public func didUnMute() {
        // Do what you want when didUnMute is called
    }

    public func didLoop() {
        // Do what you want when didLoop is called
    }

    public func didSetVolume(_: Float) {
        // Do what you want when didSetVolume is called
    }

    public func didSeek(_: CMTime, _: CMTime) {
        // Do what you want when didSeek is called
    }

    public func didEnd() {
        // Do what you want when didEnd is called
    }

    public func didError(_: Error) {
        // Do what you want when didError is called
    }

    public func didVideoSizeChanged(_: CGSize) {
        // Do what you want when didVideoSizeChanged is called
    }
}
```

5. Registers the delegate

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    ...
    self.playerView.addDelegate(self)
}
```

6. To use fullscreen, you must pass the view controller to the player view

```swift
override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    ...
    playerView.viewController = self
}
```

# Sample application

A demo application demonstrates how to use player.
See [`/example`](https://github.com/apivideo/api.video-swift-player/tree/main/Examples)
folder.

On the first run, you will have to set your video Id:

1. Replace "YOUR_VIDEO_ID" by your video Id
